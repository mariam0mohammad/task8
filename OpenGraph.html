    <h2>What is Open Graph (OG)?</h2>
    <p>Open Graph (OG) is a protocol developed by Facebook that enables 
        web pages to become rich objects in a social graph. It allows 
        developers to control how their content is displayed when shared on 
        social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and others.
         By adding specific metadata to a webpageâ€™s <head> section, you can define 
            how the page looks when someone shares its link.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Use Open Graph?</h2>
    <p>Add OG meta tags to the <head> section of your HTML document. 
        These tags provide metadata about the webpage, such as the title,
         description, image, and URL.
